In a Hilbert space threaded by superposition, the wavefunction collapses under measurement, entangling eigenstates across nonlocal manifolds. A fermionic excitation tunnels through a potential barrier while bosonic fields oscillate in vacuum fluctuations. The Hamiltonian commutes with hidden symmetries.
